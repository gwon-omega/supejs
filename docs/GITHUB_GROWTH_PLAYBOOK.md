# Super App GitHub Growth Playbook (2026+)

> Goal: build toward a breakout OSS trajectory with sustainable trust, quality, and community momentum.

## 1) Product Strategy: become the "default starter intelligence layer"

### Positioning
- Own a clear category: **"cross-ecosystem app bootstrapping + design intelligence"**.
- Focus on practical value in 60 seconds: one command, useful output, low risk.

### Wedge
- Be the best **compare + decide + scaffold** CLI for modern frameworks.
- Keep human-readable and JSON outputs for both solo devs and platform teams.

## 2) OSS Growth Engine

### Distribution loops
- Weekly showcase posts: "This week in Super App" with before/after examples.
- Publish templates/examples to multiple ecosystems (Node, Deno, Bun).
- Encourage users to share generated stacks with a branded footer snippet.

### Contributor loops
- "Good first issue" lane with strict triage SLA (<48h first response).
- Monthly community roadmap vote in Discussions.
- Contributor spotlight in release notes.

## 3) Product Quality Bar (star growth depends on trust)

### Non-negotiables
- 0 broken main branch.
- Fast CI with tests + smoke CLI checks.
- Semantic versioning with changelog and migration notes.

### UX standards
- Every command should have:
  - `--help`
  - machine-readable `--json`
  - examples in docs
  - actionable error messages

## 4) Must-have repo mechanics

### GitHub setup checklist
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Security policy + responsible disclosure path
- Issue templates (bug, feature request)
- PR template with quality checklist
- Labels and triage automation

### Release mechanics
- Weekly or biweekly releases (predictable cadence)
- "What changed" + "Why it matters" format
- Changelog automation from PR titles/labels

## 5) Content Strategy for 200k-star ambition

### High-leverage content
- Comparison guides: "Next vs Nuxt vs Remix in one command"
- Architecture explainers with decision matrices
- 10-minute video demos and short clips
- Curated starter galleries with screenshots and links

### SEO + discoverability
- Problem-led README sections (not just feature lists)
- Keywords around starter templates, scaffolding, DX tooling
- Publish docs site with framework-specific landing pages

## 6) Enterprise adoption path (drives credibility)

- Add team features: presets, policy checks, reusable org templates.
- Add API mode for platform engineering teams.
- Provide telemetry opt-in with transparent docs.

## 7) Metrics to track weekly

- New stars/week
- Fork-to-star ratio
- Returning contributor count
- Median issue first-response time
- Release frequency and adoption
- CLI success/failure rates (opt-in telemetry)

## 8) 12-month milestone plan

### Q1: Foundation
- Complete repo mechanics and docs.
- Publish 20 high-quality examples.
- Reach consistent release cadence.

### Q2: Growth
- Launch preset marketplace (community-contributed templates).
- Start monthly community calls.
- Cross-post technical deep-dives.

### Q3: Expansion
- Add enterprise-grade features and API mode.
- Partner with framework communities.
- Improve onboarding and docs UX.

### Q4: Scale
- Run annual "Starter Build Challenge".
- Publish state-of-framework report from catalog data.
- Invest in integrations (VS Code extension, CI bots).

## 9) Realistic expectation

200k stars by 2026 is extremely ambitious; optimize for **retention + trust + sustained utility**. Star growth follows solved pain + distribution consistency over time.
