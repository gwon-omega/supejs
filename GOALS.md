# Super App Goals

## Phase 1 (done)
- Move core implementation to Node.js
- Keep goal/task domain with JSON persistence
- Add Node test coverage for critical flows

## Phase 2 (done)
- Unified Node CLI (`demo`, `install-hints`, `starter`)
- Starter scaffold planning for popular frameworks
- UI library selection support
- Multi-package-manager awareness

## Phase 3 (done)
- Expand framework coverage (including Deno Fresh)
- Expand UI component ecosystem coverage
- Add visual/psychological design guidance presets for dev + user friendliness

## Phase 4 (done)
- Add comprehensive catalog/research output for frameworks, UI libraries, and package managers
- Enforce ecosystem compatibility in scaffold planning
- Expand automated tests for compatibility and catalog behavior

## Phase 5 (done)
- Add plugin-ready preset bundles (`saas`, `dashboard`, `commerce`)
- Add CI workflow template snippets in starter output
- Add security baseline features (policy report, validation gates, safer defaults)
- Add proper open-source governance files (license, contributing, conduct, security policy)
- Expand preset categories with research metadata and query filters
- Add cross-platform script generation (`bash`/`powershell`/`cmd`) and environment doctor checks
- Harden project-name validation for Windows reserved paths and safer execution behavior
- Reduce environment diagnostics latency with low-overhead command discovery and cache refresh support
- Add execution allowlist/timeout guardrails and Deno Fresh run-ready command generation
- Web UI for goal management + starter generation
- Multi-user support and remote sync (local profile workspace + remote sync planning implemented via `profile` and `sync`)
- Notifications/reminders (starter automation guidance implemented via `reminder` command)


## Phase 8 (future)
- Advanced preset provenance (signature chains, transparency logs)
- Policy-as-code for scaffold governance and organization guardrails (phase started: `policy-check` command + JSON policy file evaluation)
- Optional cloud-assisted recommendations with strict privacy controls
